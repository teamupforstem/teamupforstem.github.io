competition_details: '<p>Students gain experience with the physics of flying objects as they learn to maneuver their drones through the sky, building skills such as problem solving, organization, and collaboration. From the minute their drones first lift off, and likely immediately crash into the wall, students are encouraged to think critically: Was there an off-by-one indexing error in their code? Did they swap the drone&#39;s forward and backward propellers?</p> <p></p> <p>
       These questions and more are brought up time and again as they work through the competition&#39;s different missions:
      </p>
      <ul style="text-align: left; margin: 20px 0; padding: 0 20px; ">
        <li><strong>Autonomous Flight:</strong> Emphasizing skills in computers and programming, the drone must complete a course without continuous user input.</li>
        <li><strong>Teamwork Mission:</strong> Teams pair up, making their way through a field of tasks that can&#39;t be completed without mutual participation and patience.</li>
        <li><strong>Piloting Skills:</strong> Students have the chance to showcase their dexterity as they maneuver the drone around obstacles under the pressure of time.</li>
        <li><strong>Communications Challenge:</strong> A written log judged on technical writing and clarity is presented in an interview on the team&#39;s work throughout the season.</li>
      </ul><p>Team members typically specialize in either coding or piloting, but this varies based on team dynamics and the decisions of the students.</p>
      <p>
      All team members must contribute to the communications challenge logbook, including tasks such as writing, record-keeping, research, and formatting.</p>
      <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> Students are required to wear protective goggles at all times that the drone is in flight as a safety precaution.</p>'

{{< basic-overview title="Aerial Drone Competition Experience" >}}
 The Robotics Education & Competition Foundation's (RECF) Aerial Drone Competition provides a unique hands-on learning experience, fostering crucial STEM skills including drone piloting, programming, and problem-solving.

The competition environment mirrors the real world, requiring teamwork, critical thinking, and innovation to navigate mission challenges. Students learn to collaborate effectively, hone their communication skills, and build the resilience to tackle future challenges. This fosters a deep understanding of flight principles, documentation, and interpersonal skills, all while igniting a passion for drone-related careers.

Teams learn about drones, flight principles, programming, documentation, and communication skills while expanding their understanding of and building interest in drone-related workforce and career opportunities. 

Teams compete in four missions: Teamwork, Piloting, Autonomous Flight, and Communications.
