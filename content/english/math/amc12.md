    <li><strong>What it is:</strong> A national high-school mathematics contest assessing problem-solving across the full pre-calculus curriculum; intended for students in grades 12 and below (typically grades 11â€“12; advanced younger students may also participate).</li>
    <li><strong>Duration & questions:</strong> 25 multiple-choice questions in 75 minutes. Calculators are not permitted on the AMC 12.</li>
    <li><strong>What it covers:</strong> Algebra (equations, inequalities, functions), number theory (divisibility, modular arithmetic), geometry (Euclidean and coordinate), counting and probability (combinatorics), and other pre-calculus topics; calculus is not included.</li>
    <li><strong>How to prepare:</strong> Practice past AMC 12 papers under light timing, review official solutions, and strengthen core topics with emphasis on problem translation, estimation, pattern spotting, and careful checking.</li>
