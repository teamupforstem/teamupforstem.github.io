<p>The Math Olympiads for Elementary and Middle Schools (MOEMS®) is a globally recognized program that builds problem-solving skills, mathematical creativity, and perseverance. Founded in 1979, MOEMS® now serves over 120,000 students each year across all 50 U.S. states and 39 countries. It offers two divisions—Division E (Grades 4–6) and Division M (Grades 6–8)—with teams of up to 35 students.</p>

<p>MOEMS® contests are administered at Team Up for STEM in a paper-based format, where students receive printed problem sheets and record answers on paper during a proctored session. Each contest consists of 5 problems to be completed individually within 30 minutes, with no calculators allowed unless specifically permitted by the organizer. Teams (up to 35 students) meet in person, follow standardized instructions, and submit their papers for scoring—1 point per correct answer—contributing to each student’s season total out of 25 points across the five contests. </p>

<p>How do we prepare? You can use the official MOEMS® <a href="https://moems.org/moems-shops/">practice materials and past problems</a>, form a study group, and practice regularly with timed sets. Focus on learning multiple solution strategies and reviewing mistakes. Many families also supplement with problem-solving books and math circles. For local support, <a href="https://blueridgeboost.com/">Blue Ridge Boost</a> offers in-person preparation <a href="https://blueridgeboost.com/classes/math/">classes</a> that cover problem-solving techniques, contest strategies, and targeted practice.</p>
